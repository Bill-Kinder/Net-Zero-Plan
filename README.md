# NetZeroPlan
A Git repository for our net zero project. Calculate the number of trees and cost of planting them to offset the Net Zero Initiative's carbon dioxide equivalent emissions!

# Files
- "CLICK ME! (MAC).command": Runs the program on MAC OS.
- "CLICK ME! (WINDOWS).py": Runs the program on Windows OS. Also contains the main code for the program.
- "Program.py": Contains code used by the program.
- "config.csv": Comma-separated value (csv) file containing 3 headings: "Cost of 1 tree (AUD)", "CO2 equivalent absorbed by 1 tree (kgCO2e)" and "Parameters file name". Parameters can be edited by opening the csv file in a spreadsheet or text editor (e.g.: Excel). However, the file extension must always be ".csv".
  - Cost of 1 tree: By default we assumed 1 tree costs $1.55 in Australian Dollars. This can be changed by the user if necessary.
  - CO2 equivalent absorbed by 1 tree: By default we assumed 1 tree absorbs 25kg of CO2 equivalent per year of its life. This can be changed if necessary.
  - Parameters file name: By default, set to "params.csv". If the user has a different parameters file, this field can be changed. However, the parameters file must always have the extension ".csv".
